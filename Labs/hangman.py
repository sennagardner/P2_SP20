# display the hangman using the gallows
# display the used letters so the user knows what has been selected
# display the length of the word to the user using blank spaces and used letters
# prompt the user to guess a letter
# don't allow the user to select the same letter twice
# if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1
# if the incorrect_guesses is greater than 8, tell the user they lost and exit the program
# if the user gets all the correct letters, tell the user they won

# ask if they want to play again
