# LISTS (25pts)
# Show work on all problems.  Manually finding the answer doesn't count

# PROBLEM 1 (Using List Comprehensions - 8pts)
# Use list comprehensions to do the following:
# a) Make a list of numbers from 1 to 100
my_list = [x for x in range(101)]
print(my_list)
# b) Make a list of even numbers from 20 to 40
my_list2 = [x for x in range(20, 41) if x % 2 == 0]
print(my_list2)
# c) Make a list of squares from 1 to 100 (1 ** 2 to 100 ** 2)
my_list3 = [x ** 2 for x in range(101)]
print(my_list3)
# d) Make a list of all positive numbers in my_list below.

# PROBLEM 2 (Import the number list - 3pts)
# The Problems directory contains a file called "number_list.py"
# import this file which contains num_list
# Print the last 5 numbers in num_list

from Problems.number_list import *

# PROBLEM 3 (List functions and methods - 8pts)
# Find and print the highest number in num_list (1pt)
print(max(num_list))
# Find and print the lowest number in num_list (1pt)
print(min(num_list))
# Find and print the average of num_list (2pts)
print(sum(num_list) / len(num_list))
# Remove the lowest number from num_list (2pt)

# Create and print a new list called top_ten which contains only the 10 highest numbers in num_list(2pts)

# PROBLEM 4 (4pts)
# Find the number which appears most often in num_list?

my_count = [num_list.count(x) for x in num_list]

# CHALLENGE PROBLEMS (2pts)
# TOUGH PROBLEMS, BUT FEW POINTS

# Find the number of prime numbers in num_list?
# Hint: One way is to just start removing the ones that aren't
